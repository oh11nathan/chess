# Just some notes to keep in mind when creating tests for your project, copy pasted from some RSPEC tutorials
# With .rb extension because it was weird to read non-green text in VSCode

# describe -> Name of the method that is being tested.
# context ->  Explains the conditions of the test.
# it ->       Explains the results of the test.

# In general, you probably have 4 different types of methods:
# 1. Command - Changes the observable state, but does not return a value.
# 2. Query - Returns a result, but does not change the observable state.
# 3. Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning anything.
# 4. Looping Script - Only calls other methods, usually without returning
#    anything, and stops when certain conditions are met.

# Let's take a look at methods that should always be tested:

# 1. Public Command or Public Query Methods should always be tested, because
# they are the public interface. Command Methods should test the method's action
# or side effect. Query Methods should test the method's return value.

# 2. Command or Query Methods that are inside a public script or looping script
# method should be tested. For the games that we are making, script and looping
# script methods are just a convenient way to call the methods needed to play a
# full game. Since these methods are required to play the game, they should be
# publicly tested methods (even if you previously made them private). Pretend
# that someone will be using your class to make their own game with customized
# text. Any method that they would need in their game should be a publicly
# tested method.

# 3. Any method that sends a command message to another class should always test
# that those messages were sent.

# 4. A Looping Script Method should test the behavior of the method. For
# example, that it stops when certain conditions are met.

# Here is a summary of what should be tested
# 1. Command Method -> Test the change in the observable state
# 2. Query Method -> Test the return value
# 3. Method with Outgoing Command -> Test that a message is sent
# 4. Looping Script Method -> Test the behavior of the method

# There are a handful of methods that you do not need to test:

# 1. You do not have to test #initialize if it is only creating instance
# variables. However, if you call methods inside the initialize method, you
# might need to test #initialize and/or the inside methods. In addition, you
# will need to stub any inside methods because they will be called when you
# create an instance of the class.

# 2. You do not have to test methods that only contain 'puts' or 'gets' 
# because they are well-tested in the standard Ruby library.

# 3. Private methods do not need to be tested because they should have test
# coverage in public methods. However, as previously discussed, you may have
# some private methods that are called inside a script or looping script method;
# these methods should be tested publicly.
